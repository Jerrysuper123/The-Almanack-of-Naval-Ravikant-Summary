# The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant-Summary

This summarizes the learnings from the book.

## “Clear thinker” is a better compliment than “smart.” 
`The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. [4] The advanced concepts in a field are less proven. We use them to signal insider knowledge, but we’d be better off nailing the basics. [11] `

Real knowledge comes from the basics. So what defines real knowledge, with which you could:
1. Predice the future - making better judgement call
2. Create something out of reality - a product or service that could impact the society

Beyond this, many knowledge in this world and what being studied in school are quite not useful.

Some of basic/real knowlege:
1. Statistics
2. Microeconomics
3. Basic math
4. Finance and investment knowlege for a specific company
5. Basic English
6. Coding and system design
7. Basic science and engineering
8. Basic communication

Some of advanced knowledge (not proven and does not yield consistent results):
1. adv English vocabulary that no one understand
2. Macroeconomics - esp those theories trying to predict the future but fails miserably (never like this subject in uni)
3. String theory
4. Relativity theory
5. advanced philosophy
6. The theories behind AI (at least for me now)



## Happiness from peace, which comes from a place of lacks nothing
"Today, I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.
We are highly judgmental survival-and-replication machines.

We constantly walk around thinking, “I need this,” or “I need that,” trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something.

In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence, then you are content, and you are happy. Feel free to disagree. Again, it’s different for everybody."

Money only plays a very small of part of bringing happiness.
Happiness comes from 2 things:
1. lacks nothing
  - Once my mind thinks I lacks something A
  - My mind will start looking for A in an unhappy state, until I found A
  - Eventually when I found A, but happiness only lasts for a moment
  - Then unhappiness starts again when I started pursuing B
3. Lower sense of self

The above is very similar to what is written in bible:
Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, a whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. James 1

- Trial or suffering start when you think you lack something internally or externally
1. Consider you are living peacefully one day, until you have the desires to purchase a bigger house
2. The desires come in and the path of pursuing a new house is unhappy, because you think you lack the bigger house
3. However, when you finally got the house, you are only happy for a brief moment.
   
- That you could not trust that God could provide abundantly or lay out the best plan for you
