# The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant-Summary

This summarizes the learnings from the book.

## Making money is not a thing you do, it is a skill you learn
`If i lose all my money and dropped me on a random street...within five or ten years, I'd become wealthy again because it is just a skillset that I have developed that anyone can develop.`
Many actually attribute monetary success to luck. Some could make overnight success but they could never retain the wealth/ or making good use of money.

It is definitely a skill you development over time - making money and making good use of money. Do not agree that anyone could develop money-making skillset, but you definitely need can-do mentality and keep nurturing the skills of creating value for the society. Schools and parents only taught you how to find a good job; they never teach you how to create real value in society, because it is tough and probably they do not know how to do it either.

## “Clear thinker” is a better compliment than “smart.” 
`The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. [4] The advanced concepts in a field are less proven. We use them to signal insider knowledge, but we’d be better off nailing the basics. [11] `

Real knowledge comes from the basics. So what defines real knowledge, with which you could:
1. Predice the future - making better judgement call
2. Create something out of reality - a product or service that could impact the society

Beyond this, many knowledge in this world and what being studied in school are quite not useful.

Some of basic/real knowlege:
1. Statistics
2. Microeconomics
3. Basic math
4. Finance and investment knowlege for a specific company
5. Basic English
6. Coding and system design
7. Basic science and engineering
8. Basic communication
9. Accounting

Some of advanced knowledge (not proven and does not yield consistent results):
1. adv English vocabulary that no one understand
2. Macroeconomics - esp those theories trying to predict the future but fails miserably (never like this subject in uni)
3. String theory
4. Relativity theory
5. advanced philosophy
6. The theories behind AI (at least for me now)
7. Adv science and math
8. Daily news (nowdays news is like junk food
9. Social media

### confused thinkers forget who they are in the world; fearless thoughts define who you are as a real person
Formal education helps to build our capacity to learn but at the same time take away our creativity and individuality.

Disfunctional family could also clip your ability to dream; you dare not venture out being afraid of getting hurt again. Or the reverse, some become too aggressive, without fears at all.

I can say I am too rational nowadays with all the theories/modals from schooling, but less likely to be daring and hear within the fearless thoughts.

These deepest, fearless thoughts, I think really define who we are as individuals. Because we come this this world to overcome these fear and anxiety, but now clouded by schooling/parenting and setbacks along the way.

Being fearless does not mean you could do anything in the world; being fearless means liberating yourself - it is a relationship with your fear and yourself
- I do not dare to admit who really I am - admitting those fearless thoughts. This is the first layer of clouding. 
- Then I am not being who really I am, so my inner compass searches for external knowledge I do not really need. This is the second layer of clouding. 
- From the confused knowledge, I search for external materials to satisfy my confused needs & wants. This is the third layer of clouding/confusiong.

The best question to ask yourself is:
`If without fears or failures, what do you want to do now?`

## Free from expectations
`I don’t measure my effectiveness at all. I don’t believe in self-measurement. I feel like this is a form of self-discipline, self-punishment, and self-conflict. If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that’s their problem. If they have an agreement with you, it’s your problem. But, if they have an expectation of you, that’s completely their problem. It has nothing to do with you. They’re going to have lots of expectations out of life. The sooner you can dash their expectations, the better. [1]`

Wrong expectations of self-control - today it proves again that we human beings have no self-control at all, just like what the bible said:
- could someone with depression come out of it on their own
- could someone with addiction e.g. sexual, drug or alcohol come out of this on their own
Hardly, we have no self-control at all. Actually, this is a bad vocabulary to use. It should be we have no self-control, but we could have self-influence.

Also, bad parenting reinforces that `you should be do this and do that...`. Parents with aggressive parenting style try to mould their children to their likings, not according to the will of god. Overtime, this parenting style would cause confusion in children, and they do not know who they really are. I should become a doctor or banker to earn big bucks etc. This becomes an invisible form of self-discipline, self-punishment, and self-conflict. Overtime, many a times we see these children grow up with a gaping hole internally, collapsing under any forms of pressure, slipping into depression. Thank you parents for not dealing with your own fear and anxiety, but projecting into us, and our parents should thank their parents for doing that. If you could, as a child, be respectful and reject your parents' expectations against who you really are as a person. This could possibly break the generational curse, and it is never late to start.

Then the society has all the rubbish teachings - all very short-sighted.
- You should measure your effectiveness or productivity
- You should set up a goal and try to achieve them (this might work in the corporate world - making money as the final goal, but terrible for personal development because a one dimensional goal makes you look forward and many times you forget to reflect what you really want, and look at the other dimentions; we human beings are multi-dimensional)

If you agree with me that we human beings have no self-control, let us imagine one morning, you just woke up:
- After listening to Youtube video about setting goal in life, you started setting a goal in life (most people are not clear of what they want in life - so setting goal is meaningless and it will not motivate them forward)
- Then to be effectively, you woke up at exactly 9 am and set minor goals to achieve every 2-3 hours
- I need to reply Email with 3 hours
- I can only eat lunch for 1 hour
- I need to start working at 1 pm after lunch

Well, you have turned a playful day into a day of self-punishment. In above, you have put on at least 7 layers of expectations on yourself to become who you really are not sure if you want to become.
`What a day!`

I am still like the above until this day, and I just came to realize each such day is such a self-punishment day. `Self-discipline` please go to the rubbish bin now.

Then I remember a conversation in anime that a character talks about how he comes a hero with so power power:
`I never thought I could become a hero. I just like conquering dungeons, monsters and treasure hunting. For each floor in the dungeon, I will take my time to explore everything on the floor before leaving. I was doing like that everyday, then I become a hero.`

The anime hero is the typical hero we see in our real lives; they become successful because they really enjoy what they are doing, and many of them do not even have a goal at the start.
- Does setting goal apply here? Human beings cannot predict and do not know tomorrow. The anime hero above obviously did not have a goal of becoming a hero.
- Does productivity apply here? The anime hero took his time to explore everything on the same floor, focusing on productivity is likely to force you to go to the next floor quickly. In most things in life, Bruce Lee wisely said: `I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."` So productivity hacks please go to the rubbish bin now.

What is the catch here?

No expectations! No productivity hacks! No measurements! No goal settings!

The anime hero each day just starts doing what he likes to do, and he really enjoys it. And eventually, his ultimate goal becomes very clear to him. Rather living someone else's life externally, the hero is projecting the authencity of his inner soul into the world - passion of his soul is shaking the world.

We believe each day you could do this do. If you lack of motivation today, maybe you are currently living someone else' life and you have forgot what you really like. But you could ask yourself right now, what do i really want to do today? But be courageous to let go of good to become great in life.


## Happiness from peace, which comes from a place of lacks nothing
"Today, I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.
We are highly judgmental survival-and-replication machines.

We constantly walk around thinking, “I need this,” or “I need that,” trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is the state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and stops running into the past or future to regret something or to plan something.

In that absence, for a moment, you have internal silence. When you have internal silence, then you are content, and you are happy. Feel free to disagree. Again, it’s different for everybody."

Money only plays a very small of part of bringing happiness.
Happiness comes from 2 things:
1. lacks nothing
  - Once my mind thinks I lacks something A
  - My mind will start looking for A in an unhappy state, until I found A
  - Eventually when I found A, but happiness only lasts for a moment
  - Then unhappiness starts again when I started pursuing B
3. Lower sense of self

The above is very similar to what is written in bible:
Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, a whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. James 1

- Trial or suffering start when you think you lack something internally or externally
1. Consider you are living peacefully one day, until you have the desires to purchase a bigger house
2. The desires come in and the path of pursuing a new house is unhappy, because you think you lack the bigger house
3. However, when you finally got the house, you are only happy for a brief moment.
   
- That you could not trust that God could provide abundantly or lay out the best plan for you
