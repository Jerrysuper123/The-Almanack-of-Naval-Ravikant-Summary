This summarizes the learnings from the book.

## Happiness from peace, which comes from a place of lacks nothing
Money only plays a very small of part of bringing happiness.
Happiness comes from 2 things:
1. lacks nothing
  - Once my mind thinks I lacks something A
  - My mind will start looking for A in an unhappy state, until I found A
  - Eventually when I found A, but happiness only lasts for a moment
  - Then unhappiness starts again when I started pursuing B
3. Lower sense of self

The above is very similar to what is written in bible:
Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, a whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. James 1

- Trial or suffering start when you think you lack something internally or externally
1. Consider you are living peacefully one day, until you have the desires to purchase a bigger house
2. The desires come in and the path of pursuing a new house is unhappy, because you think you lack the bigger house
3. However, when you finally got the house, you are only happy for a brief moment.
   
- That you could not trust that God could provide abundantly or lay out the best plan for you
